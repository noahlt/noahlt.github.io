  <dd>
    <p>Most of this book is a manifesto for materialism.  There's a bit of misdirection in that Kondo exhorts us to throw away most of our possessions, which makes it seem like a minimalist manifesto, but in fact this book's central message is: you should derive joy, not just happiness but <i>joy</i>, from your possessions.  Given the commotion surrounding this book following the New York Times review, I'm surprised I haven't seen any commentary on its materialist foundation.</p>
    <p>The parts of this book which contain practical tips for organizing things, I have found very useful, to the extent which I have put them into practice.</p>

  <dd><p>A collection of essays on the themes behind the Long Now Foundation.  I like the Long Now Foundation and I generally agree with their work.  This book contains a few great bits, but the rest&mdash;while fun to think about&mdash;didn't particularly change my thinking.  Perhaps this was because I'm already familiar with most of their ideas; your mileage may vary.</p></dd>

  <dd><p>I read this book on the recommendation of a friend who enjoyed it a lot, I suspect because he didn't grow up around religious texts the way I did.  Like many religious texts, this book offers some general platitudes with a few profound-sounding vague maxims which you may interpret as you will.</p></dd>

 <i>by</i> Stephen Baxter</dt>
  <dd><p>This fits a very particular genre of hard science fiction short stories: speculation about possibilities, particularly the possibilities for exotic forms of extraterrestrial life.  If you enjoy hearing plausible new ideas purely for the sake of considering their novelty, you'll enjoy this a lot.</p></dd>

 <i>by</i> Donna Tartt</dt>
  <dd><p>The first few pages of <cite>The Secret History</cite> lay out both the central event and central theme of the story.  Like in Olivier's <cite>Hamlet</cite>, we're given at the onset a very simple theme: this is the story of a man who wanted to see everything in beauty.</p>

  <p>After finishing the novel, my stomach turned for about an hour.  On one hand, it was tragic; on the other hand, they deserved it.  To be honest I don't often read this sort of modern fiction, precisely to avoid this feeling of ugly, unredeemable tragedy.</p>

  <p>I suppose I could satisfy the classicist in me by regarding The Secret History as a parable about (as the English professor says near the beginning of the novel) elevating beauty above truth.  But casting it in that light doesn't make the story sound very beautiful, either.</p>

  <p>And I must admit, the story <i>was</i> very beautiful.</p></dd>

  <dd>
    <p>I read this before reading <cite>The Swerve</cite>, discussed below, just so that I could form my own opinion before hearing from Greenblatt.  It also was the last prominent piece of Roman philosophy that I had not yet read.  <cite>On The Nature of Things</cite> is Lucretius' account of the Epicurean worldview and philosophy, told in verse.  Epicureanism was one of the early philosophies that was entirely materialistic (as opposed to supernatural) and one of the early proponents of the atomic theory.</p>

    <p>Because Epicureanism said there were no gods and that everything happens due to entirely physical causes (namely the movement of atoms), modern readers have a tendency to link Epicureanism with modernism and science.  But it's important to note that nothing in Lucretius is science in the sense that none of it is <i>empirical</i>: it's just speculation unsupported by data, which happens to match some of our contemporary empirical scientific beliefs.  Epicurus deserves recognition for originality as one of the early proponents of atheist materialism, but we should not confuse this with empirical science.</p>

    <p>Similarly, because Epicurus preached the pursuit of pleasure (the diluted form of which gives us the contemporary usage of "epicurean" roughly equivalent to "foodie"), affluent modern readers can easily read Epicureanism into their luxurious lifestyle.  But Lucretius explicitly repudiates luxury.  Epicureanism experienced a resurgence in the late Roman empire because its pursuit of pleasure was a way to deal with life in the hopeless world of the crumbling empire where progress seemed impossible.  A cursory reading of Lucretius feels modern, but he has far more in common with the Stoics than any modern mindset.</p>

    <p>Among translations, I highly recommend the one linked above, which translates the Latin verse into fun-to-read English fourteener.  I particularly enjoyed reading descriptions of physical phenomena presented in rhymed and metered verse, which I suppose was part of the novelty of the original poem as well.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>I read this for a book club.  I mostly agree with <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/review/why-stephen-greenblatt-is-wrong-and-why-it-matters">the LA Review's description</a>: <cite>The Swerve</cite> actually contains multiple books.  The first is a fascinating account of the rediscovery of Lucretius by Poggio Braccionlini, giving a good flavor of the early Renaissance. The second book is a facile antireligious polemic that presents the rediscovery of Lucretius as the turning point from a caricatured Middle Ages to a hagiographic Englightenment.</p>

    <p>The third book contained in <cite>The Swerve</cite> (and here I diverge from the LA Review) is a muddled account of "how the world became modern" via Lucretius.  Greenblatt presents a handful of examples of later thinkers who explicitly cited Lucretius as an influence but fails to form a compelling case.</p>

    <p>What would happen if the moon blew up? That's not a spoiler, that's just the first page of the book, and it really takes off from there.  <cite>Seveneves</cite> is an incredibly engaging piece of hard science fiction&mdash;probably my second favorite (behind Anathem).</p>

  <dd>
    <p>This history is fascinating because it follows the story of a single thing, which is not a people-group or geographic region, for three thousand years.  People-groups and geography feel somewhat arbitrary to me, and general or political histories often feel unfocused.  The history of Christianity provides an interesting topical focus while also allowing us to follow a story for a very long span of time.</p>

    <p>One of my biggest impressions from this book is the surprising diversity of Christian thought.  It's easy to lump groups of people together, especially when they ostensibly share a set of core beliefs, but the fact is that the label "Christianity" has been taken up by many belief-systems which a contemporary Christian might not recognize as such, and even contemporary mainstream Christianity includes a surprising diversity of beliefs.</p>

    <p>Many of the groups described in the book hold bizarre beliefs.  MacCulloch writes history in a way which is, I think, profound: he leads us to understand and empathize with each group of people in each situation.  After reading about each group, their beliefs, and their context, I may still disagree with them, but I cannot write them off.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>This is some good hard science fiction.  Perhaps this novel should actually be considered <i>engineering fiction</i>, because most of it is actually about problem solving.  Weir throws problem after problem at our protagonist Mark Watney, and the plot mostly driven, not by drama or action, but by Watney's problem solving.</p>

    <p>One of my friends dislikes this book because the prose is not beautiful and Watney solves most of his problems with high school chemistry and algebra.  These criticisms are fair; nonetheless, I defy anyone to find a better narrative about problem-solving.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Some good ideas here, presented very concisely.  I am embarrassed to admit, because I feel I should have absorbed this idea earlier in life, that I was most impressed by the idea of "small groups of people" effecting great change.  Not single heroes, nor huge faceless institutions, but small groups where each member has a unique role.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>I find this to be a very good introduction to philosophy for the lay person.  He doesn't cover everything (it's only 300 pages, after all), but does a good job of introducing the challenges of philosophy by way of reviewing six major philosophical systems.  Like MacCulloch, Ferry makes a point of earnestly trying to understand each philosophy before judging it.</p>

  <dd><p>This novel contains no interesting speculation about the future of virtual reality.  It glorifies media consumption.  The hero is such because he has watched a lot of movies, played a lot of video games, and knows a lot of trivia.  I don't find those attributes particularly heroic, and neither should you.</p></dd>

  <dd><p>This book has earned its reputation as a science fiction classic.  It's mostly a book about exploring this alien artifact.

  <dd>
    <p>Unlike <cite>Rendezvous with Rama</cite>, I don't think <cite>Neuromancer</cite> deserves its place in the science fiction canon.  It hasn't aged well, partly because it predicted a near future which has already diverged from the present, and partly because it was not well-grounded in science and technology in the first place.</p>

    <p>It's still interesting as a period piece.  <cite>Neuromancer</cite> goes along with <cite>Serial Experiment Lain</cite> in that both grant us a sense of how people felt about computers in the past more than they let us imagine plausible futures from today (as most sci-fi does).  In particular, both are obsessed with a mythological form of cyberspace, both exhibit an understandable fixation on hardware (it's the tangible presence of computation, after all), and both plots center around godlike artificial intelligence.</p>

    <p>I first tried to read <cite>Neuromancer</cite> in high school but couldn't get past its postmodern pulp fiction prose.  This time I began to appreciate the style, but still am not a fan.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>I chose this novel as the inaugural book for my book club.  Several months after finishing <i>The Secret History</i>, I decided I actually liked it, and this one had won a Pulitzer Prize, so I figured it was a safe choice.  It generated a pretty healthy discussion, in particular as we discussed the various characters and our approval (or disapproval) of their motives and actions.</p>

    <p>I liked how this book wrestled with risk-taking vs playing it safe.  It wasn't as agonizing as <cite>The Secret History</cite> but gave me more to think about (though the final chapter's philosophizing about life and art is a bit overdone).  As with <cite>The Secret History</cite>, I enjoyed Tartt's prose and storytelling very much.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Another book club book.  This is the first book I've read by Goethe!  I enjoyed it very much.  In storytelling, it reminded me of <cite>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</cite>, one of my favorite movies.  There are no secrets here: by the end of the second chapter you can predict how the book will end.  The greatness of the book is watching things unravel.  By the end of the book, it hurts a lot.</p>

    <p>I'm told that the Oxford World's Classics translation (linked above) is the best English edition of the book.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>I haven't actually finished reading this one yet, but I only have 150 pages to go.  I read the bulk of this book in 2015, so I'm including it here.</p>

    <p>There are some well-known criticisms of this book: Russell spends too much time on early Greek philosophy and not enough time on some modern philosophers.  There are some facts which were not known in Russell's time (seventy years ago) which modern scholarship has learned (some, in fact, I was familiar with due to MacCulloch).</p>

    <p>Russell doesn't take the charitable approach that MacCulloch and Ferry took in their books (see above).  He doesn't make nearly the same effort to empathize with and understand each philosopher.  Indeed, much of the book reads like Russell telling us why every philosopher (besides himself) is wrong.  At times this can be a downer.</p>

    <p>On the other hand: Steve Jobs once said it's important to internalize the fact that the entire world around you was created by people no smarter than you.  When contemplating the ediface of civilization, or any field, it can be hard to adopt that mindset, but reading Bertrand Russell telling you why all the philosophers are wrong seems to help.  No philosopher, no matter how important or influential, is above being challenged.</p>

    <p>I'm still on the fence about this one.  Perhaps by the end I'll have more to say.  At times, particularly during the section on Medieval Philosophy, I continued reading only because I didn't want to quit.  I think a casual student would do well to read the introductory chapters to each section, the chapters on Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, and Ancient Philosophy After Aristotle, then skip to the section on Modern Philosophy.</p>

<p>This year I read more books (18) than in any of the years since finishing high school.  There were three major forces here: I've been reading every night before going to bed; I did a lot more compulsory reading (4, for book clubs and such), and I did a lot more reading on vacation (6).  For instance, I went on a science fiction kick in the fall, mostly while in transit to Japan.  Looking back, I see that I read lot more fiction than I thought.  But that's a bit exaggerated in this format, because MacCulloch and Russell are two very hefty non-fiction books which dominated this year's reading.</p>
